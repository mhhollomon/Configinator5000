# Configinator5000

Place holder

library to help with both parsing and validation of config files.

For some configuration files, validating the structure of the parsed settings (required keys are present, no unknown keys are present) can
be as time consuming as the parsing of the syntax.

- will be based on libconfig
- will be C++17 based.
- will allow the user to specify a schema for the target configuration.
- will be setup to work nicely with FetchConfig.
